## Coding and Waffle...charts :)

I don't know how to make a waffle by programming but, there are waffle charts in Python. These wcharts are used to represent progress or percentages with a grid. You can generate waffle charts in Python using the [PyWaffle](https://pywaffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package:

```
$ pip install pywaffle
```

Once a file is created it must be managed. Otherwise, it remains at risk until action is taken on it:
- Files take up space on a hard drive and high-resolution images can take up a lot of space. File volumes are expressed in bytes
- Pay attention to the sizes of files, they can provide hints to potential problems in the digitalization process. For example a corrupted file may be incomplete and therefore dramatically smaller than the others.
- Files have Metadata embedded within them. It is called EXIF data.
- File organization is important
- File names help with organization

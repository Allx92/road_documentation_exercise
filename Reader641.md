Once a file is created it must be managed. Otherwise it remains at-risk until action is taken on it:
- Files take up space on a hard drive and high-resolution images can take up a lot of space. File volumes are expressed in bytes
- Pay attention to he sizes of files, they can provide hints to potential problems in the digitalization process. From example a corrupted file may be incomplete and therefore dramatically smaller than the other files.
- Files have Metadata embedded within them. It is called EXIF data.
- File organization is important
- File names help with organization

Once a file is created it must be managed. Otherwise, it remains at risk until action is taken on it:
- Files take up space on a hard drive and high-resolution images can take up a lot of space. File volumes are expressed in bytes
- Pay attention to the sizes of files, they can provide hints to potential problems in the digitalization process. For example a corrupted file may be incomplete and therefore dramatically smaller than the others.
- Files have Metadata embedded within them. It is called EXIF data.
- File organization is important
- File names help with organization

## File Types
- Preservation Master File (Required)
	- The original image "raw" image file
	- Little to no adjustment should be applied
	- This file gets preserved for created future versions of the file
	- TIFF file format
	- Adobe RGB 1998 color space
- Modified Master File (Optional)
	- Minor adjustments/enhancements
	- Other file versions can be created from this version
	- Best file for printing and publications
	- TIFF file format
	- sRGB Color Space
- Access file (Recommended)
	- The version that most people see, download and use
	- Suitable for email, presentations and ingesting into digital libraries
	- Reduced file size and overall quality from the previous version
	- May or may not be preserved
	- These files should not be enlarged
	- JPEG file format
	- sRGB color space

# Here is a Cookie

Speaking of cookies, they share metaphorical similarities with computer files, despite belonging to entirely different domains—one culinary and the other digital. Here's a look at what they have in common:

**Creation Process**: Just as baked cookies are created by combining ingredients according to a recipe and then baking them, computer files are created by assembling data through a process governed by specific instructions or software. In both cases, the creation process transforms basic components (ingredients or data) into a structured final product.

**Variety**: Just as there are many types of baked cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal, sugar cookies, etc.), reflecting different ingredients and recipes, there are various types of computer files (text files, image files, executable files, etc.) created for different purposes and with different formats.

**Storage**: Baked cookies are stored in containers to keep them fresh and safe, similar to how computer files are stored in directories or folders on a computer or cloud storage to keep them organized and accessible. Sharing: Both baked cookies and computer files can be shared with others. Cookies can be given as treats or gifts, while computer files can be shared via email, cloud services, or other file-sharing platforms.

**Consumption/Use**: Baked cookies are consumed for enjoyment or as part of a meal, while computer files are "consumed" or used by being opened, viewed, or executed by software programs for various purposes, including entertainment, information processing, or task execution. Finite Lifespan: Just as baked cookies have a shelf life after which they are no longer good to eat, computer files can become outdated, corrupted, or irrelevant, at which point they might be deleted or replaced.

**Customization**: Both baked cookies and computer files can be customized according to preference or need. Cookies can be modified by adding or changing ingredients, while computer files can be edited or configured to meet specific requirements.

**Batch Processing**: Cookies are often baked in batches, a method that is efficient for producing multiple items at once. Similarly, computer files can be processed in batches, such as batch renaming, converting file formats, or batch processing data, to improve efficiency in digital tasks.

Despite these metaphorical similarities, it's important to remember the fundamental differences in their nature—one being a tangible, edible product and the other being intangible and digital.

## Happy Baking!

# The Annual Family Event
Every year my family come together for a *family picnic*. The annual picnic is a time for us to spend time together, share a meal, talk, laugh, catch up on old times and have lots of fun. 


## Picnic Location
It was unanimously agreed that this year, the picnic will be held at what I consider to be the most beautiful and serene park in Barbados, **Farley Hill National Park**.

### Menu
As is customary for bajan family *"get together"* , there will be lots of food and drinks. Enough for everyone to have leftovers for a few days. The menu usually consists of: 

#### Starches
- Rice
- Sweet potato pie
- Macaroni Pie
- Shepherd Pie
  
#### Meat
- Chicken
- Pork
- Beef
- Lamb
#### Salads
- Toss
- Coleslaw
- Potato salad
- Fruit salad
  
#### Desserts
  - cake
  - ice cream

Since we are all working towards a healthier lifestyle, my sister suggested that we purchase organic produce and meats from [PEG Farm Estate]( https://www.pegbarbados.com/ "PEG Farm"). According to her, the produce and meats sold there are some of the best organic foods in the market and the prices are very affordable.

#### The End 
The entire family is really looking forward to the picnic this year, since it has been almost four years since we last had a picnic, due to the Covid pandemic. Everyone should have a good time and I look forward to hearing my mum say as she does after every picnic: 
>*this picnic was the best one yet and I just can't wait for next year's picnic*.

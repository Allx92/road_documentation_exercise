Hi there, thanks for visiting my Github. I'm Alexander Greene and I've been long intrigued by diverse languages and have been on a  mission to fuse this fascination with my interest in Tech. I am particularly interested in delving into areas like Cybersecurity and Natural Language Processing, a fascinating branch of Linguistics and Computer Science that taps into understanding, interpreting, and manipulating human language. I should mention that I am neurodiverse and come from a Humanities background (Linguistics) therefore though the territory is relatively new, I am excited to learn.

I love exploring and immersing myself in diverse cultural experiences. One of my most memorable trips was visiting Lalibela in Ethiopia, renowned for some of the world's oldest rock-hewn Churches. An extreme environment of constrasts I like to call it and the mecca of Coffee and incredibly warm people.

When I'm not engrossed in reading about some tech news, language learning or world culture , you'll likely find me running, hiking, or engaged in various activities as part of my Christian faith.

As of late, I've recently started a Data Technicaian role. This I imagine would serve as a catalyst for growth as I try to immerse myself in this new learning journey. So far I've met some incredibly knowledgeable people of various walks and so feel very grateful to learn from and work with my team, not to mention being apart of such a meaningful Digitization project.

Cheers! :clinking_glasses:

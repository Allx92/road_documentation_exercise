>When Iron Man was released in 2008, **NO ONE**, could have predicted the juggernaut Marvel Studios would become. This essay is a retrospective review of each film and an aggregate rating for the phase in question.

## Phase 1

Marvel comes out the gate with a banger in 2008's _Iron Man_ which revitalized Robert Downey Jr's career and launched the whole universe. This was followed up by _The Incredible Hulk_, _Thor_, _Captain America: The first Avenger_ , all solid origin stories,  and the first franchise sequel in _Iron Man 2_. This 1st phase is capped off by _The Avengers_, in 2012 which I considered the closest thing to a "perfect" comic book film at the time of its release. 
* Overall this phase was the perfect foundation for the MCU to launch from and I would rate it __5/5__.

## Phase 2 
 With  their feet under them, Marvel Studios fills this phase with sequels to Phase 1's releases and two more origin stories. The origin stories were _Guardians Of The Galaxy_ and _Ant Man_, which combined the comic-book genre with comedies to great effect. Surprisingly, Guardians while the most obscure comic the MCU had adapted so far, went on to become one of the most beloved franchises in the MCU Canon. 
 The sequels were _Iron Man 3_, _Thor: The Dark World_, _Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and _Avengers: Age Of Ultron_. Of the four, Captain America was an immediate hit, cementing Steve Rogers place as the second most important character after Tony Stark. The other sequels while still widely successful, would suffer a little with both fans and critics alike, but gain more recognition years after their release.
 *  Three of the six releases being fan favourites and the other 3 being financially successful if not critically, I would rate this phase  __4/5__.

## Phase 3
This phase is easily the most stacked, with 10 releases from 2016-2019 all of which were critical and financial successes for Marvel Studios. The films released were _Captain America: Civil War_,  _Doctor Strange_, _Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2_,  _Spider-Man: Homecoming_, _Thor: Ragnarok_, _Black Panther_, _Avengers: Infinity War_, _Ant Man & The Wasp_, _Captain Marvel_,  and _Avengers: Endgame_.
Infinity War and Endgame were the season finale to the MCU and brought together most of the story threads we had been following for the 10 year time period to a beautiful conclusion. In the end turning all the main Avengers cast into cinema legends along the lines of Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones or Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker. 
* As the finale to this 10 year saga, all these films were high performing and very well regarded by the film going public, I rate this phase __5/5__.

## Phase 4
The phase after Endgame is a mixed bag of sequels along with two origin stories and a prequel of sorts. The releases were _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, _Black Widow_, _The Eternals_, _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_, _Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness_, _Shang-Chi and The Legend Of The Ten Rings_,  and _Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.3_.
This group of films showcase the MCU's past and its potential future in one, with the former in Eternals/ Black Window and the latter with Black Panther, Shang-Chi etc. While still a money making machine, Marvel's recent efforts have been somewhat lackluster and while I enjoyed all these films to varying degrees this run of films have been more divisive among the fanbase and critics.
The main complaint being a lack of direction, which was more strongly felt during previous phases.  My take on it is that, the MCU still has a direction but because the storylines are disseminated through film __AND__ television, if you have not kept up to date with their __ALL__ their content then the storytelling feels weaker. That said, it doesn't help when the direction they are going in is time travel/multiversal which are sci-fi themes that can be confusing are nonsensical when done wrong.

* Overall the fourth phase of Marvel Studios films is off to a rocky start, but I am still invested in the story going forward and it gets a __3.5/5__.

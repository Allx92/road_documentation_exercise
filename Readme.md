# Documentation exercise

Today, we'll be learning the basics of two processes in parallel.

1. Documentation
1. Version Control

We will do this by contributing to a shared code repository whose purpose will be to demonstrate that we can use basic text editors to document our processes in a robust, auditable, and collaborative manner.

## Documentation

We will be following the instructions [here](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown#conclusion) to create a personalized contribution markdown file that renders nicely on GitHub.

## Version Control

We will be collaborating on this specific GitHub repository, each of us making our own markdown file to experiment with. We will submit pull requests to have our contributions folded into the main repository.

## Cheatsheet

This is an extensive write-up of how to use markdown on GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

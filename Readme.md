# Documentation exercise

Today, we'll be learning the basics of two processes in parallel.

1. Documentation
1. Version Control

We will do this by contributing to a shared code repository whose purpose will be to demonstrate that we can use basic text editors to document our processes in a robust, auditable, and collaborative manner.

## Documentation

We will be following the instructions [here](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown#conclusion) to create a personalized contribution markdown file that renders nicely on GitHub.

## Version Control

We will be collaborating on this specific GitHub repository, each of us making our own markdown file to experiment with. We will submit pull requests to have our contributions folded into the main repository.

## Cheatsheet

This is an extensive write-up of how to use markdown on GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

## Step-by-Step

Follow the below workflow.

1. Create a github account
1. Fork this repository so that you have a copy of it in your own account
1. Create a new file in your copy of the repository, and name it "YourUsername.md"
1. Write that file in markdown
	1. Commit those changes
	1. Visit that file on GitHub to see how it renders
	1. Keep updating that file until you like what you see
	1. Consider adding images, referencing the "assets" folder

## Bonus points

Our work for tomorrow is as follows. If you're ready today, though, go ahead and try to do the following:

1. Open a pull request from your fork over to my fork's "main" branch
1. I'll review your work and send you feedback
1. When I think that your work is ready for inclusion, I'll accept the pull request

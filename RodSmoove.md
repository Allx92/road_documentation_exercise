Before you trade any security or equity, you must first understand the market structure. Market structure can help you understand the behavior, condition, and current flow of the market. Market structure puts an emphasis on support & resistance levels, swing highs, and swing lows.

Market structure can be broadly classified into three distinct categories:

 * **Bullish Market Structure**:
       A bullish structure is defined by a series of higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL). The trend continues in the same direction until the asset price records a lower low (LL).

* **Bearish Market Structure**:
      A bearish structure is defined by lower lows (LL) and lower highs (LH). The price trend continues as long as lower highs (LH) are being printed and until a higher high (HH) is created

* **Sideways Market Structure**:
        The horizontal movement of price shown by equal highs (EH) and equal lows (EL) is called a sideways trend or sometimes referred to as consolidation.

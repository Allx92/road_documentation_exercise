# Toyota EP82 Starlet 

### Hello Everyone!



My name is Seanico, i had an 1994 EP82 starlet manual, at first i didn't know what a starlet was but upon digging deeping on google i found out what it looked like and the mechanical specs and what modifications they can have or come with,i was intrigued by it and i maded it my mission to look and accure one of these cars.   

In March of 2015 i got a call from one of my friends that there was a lady selling an ep82 starlet and to give her a call immediately so i did. When i finally got ahold of her she told me "she wasnt ready to sell it but i can still come and give it a look the following saturday".The day finally came to go see the vehicle and i was excited that my heart was beating at 100kph just as fast as the starlet would go with a standard engine so imagine how fast my heart was beating.

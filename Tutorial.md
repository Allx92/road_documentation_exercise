# Markdown Tutorial
## What is Markdown?
Developed in 2004 by John Gruber, Markdown refers to both (1) a way of formatting text files, as well as (2) a Perl utility to convert Markdown files into HTML. In this lesson, we’ll focus on the first part and learn to write files using the Markdown syntax.

Plain text files have many advantages over other formats. For one, they are readable on virtually all devices. They have also withstood the test of time better than other file types – if you’ve ever tried to open a document saved in a legacy word processor format, you’ll be familiar with the compatibility challenges involved.
Football is one of my favourite hobbies whether that be watching or playing.

One of my first memories of football was watching the 2009 Quarter Finals between Chelsea and Liverpool.
